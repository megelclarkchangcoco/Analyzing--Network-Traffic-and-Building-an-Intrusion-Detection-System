## Introduction
This project focuses on building an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning techniques. By the end of this project, you will have learned how to preprocess network traffic data, extract meaningful features, and implement a model to detect malicious traffic.

## Setup
1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

## Data Exploration
- Load and explore the dataset using `pandas`.
- Handle missing values and check the dataset for completeness.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the CICIDS2017 dataset
df = pd.read_csv('CICIDS2017.csv')
print(df.head())
```
-Visualize relationships between features using correlation matrices or pair plots.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Heatmap for correlation between features
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()
```

## Feature Extraction
- Engineer new features, such as the packet size ratio, to capture network traffic patterns.
```python
# Create a new feature for packet size ratio
df['packet_size_ratio'] = df['total_fwd_packets'] / df['total_bwd_packets']
```

## Feature Selection
- Apply feature selection techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or SelectKBest to choose the most relevant features.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Recursive Feature Elimination
rfe = RFE(RandomForestClassifier(), n_features_to_select=5)
rfe.fit(df.drop('label', axis=1), df['label'])
print("Selected features:", rfe.support_)
```
## Model Training and Evaluation
- Train a classification model like RandomForest and evaluate its performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop('label', axis=1), df['label'], test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"IDS Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```
## Conclusion
Summarize how feature extraction and selection improved the model's performance. Discuss the effectiveness of the IDS in     identifying malicious traffic.

## Future Work
- Explore the use of deep learning models (CNN, RNN) for improved pattern recognition in network traffic.
- Test the IDS in a real-world network environment to evaluate its performance under live conditions.
